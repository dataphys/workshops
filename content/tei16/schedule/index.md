The workshop will be divided into three phases each focusing on a different aspect of physical data representation. Phase 1 and 2 will take place on Sunday 14th February, while Phase 3 will take place over a half-day session on Tuesday 16th February.

_**Sunday 14th Feb**  
Phase 1  
Introductory talks (organisers)_  
<u>9am-11am</u>.  
We will commence with introductions from all committee members and provide an overview of the schedule of the workshop. This will be followed by 6 brief presentations (10-minutes each) that include (1) brief overview of data physicalization and the origins of the research area, (2) the state-of-the-art in physicalization, (3) shape-changing data representations, (4) data physicalization in education, (5) evaluation of physical data representations, and (6) an overview/summary of previous workshops held.

_Introductory talks (attendees)_  
<u>11am-11.30am</u>  
Madness style presentations, each participant will be given 1–minute to introduce themselves and their interest in the topic.

<u>11.30am- 12noon</u>  
This session will conclude by introducing the activities planned for the following (hands-on) session, thus allowing participants an opportunity to think about possible designs over the break.

_12noon-1pm Lunch_

_Phase 2  
Ideation, Design & Prototyping_  
<u>Hour 1pm-1.30pm.</u>  
We will introduce the participants to a range of equipment, tools and materials that will be available for them to use when creating their physicalizations. These include micro-controllers and actuators, 3D printer, Legoä, paper and card etc.

<u>1pm-5.00pm<br /> </u>The group will be divided into teams of 4, each team will be given a selection of datasets to chose from, we will also provide a facility on our website to submit datasets prior to the workshop. We will hold an open design session to discuss possible design strategies and the possibilities and limitations of the technology. Each team (mentored by a committee member) will create a unique data physicalization.

**Tuesday 16th Feb**  
Phase 3  
Reflection and discussion_  
The final part of the workshop will involve the participants presenting the physicalizations they created in phase 2. This will be followed by a round-table discussion on the role of tangibles and embodiment in the future design of data physicalizations. (We expect that some of these physicalizations will be 3D printed and will not be finished by Sunday evening; these will be printed on Monday).

One of the committee member will chair a round-table discussion. By drawing from the participants practical explorations (in phase 2), and possibly also from feedback collected from the exhibition of their creations, each group will present their physicalization and discuss their design process to capture what problems they encountered, which tools (software/technology) were missing, what limitations they encountered, etc. Practicing researchers in the area will then contribute to a discussion on the key research challenges in this area and open research topics such as design issues, technical issues, under explored areas, open questions, as well as evaluation criteria and methodologies.
