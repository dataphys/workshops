[Yvonne Jansen][1], University of Copenhagen

<p class="tab">
  is a postdoc at the University of Copenhagen. Her doctoral research focused on exploring properties and possible benefits of physicality for information visualization in the form of tangible controllers and physical representations of data. She published her work on <a href="http://www.aviz.fr/trc" target="_blank">tangible controllers for wall displays</a>, <a href="http://www.aviz.fr/makervis" target="_blank">fabrication of physical visualizations</a>, and <a href="http://www.aviz.fr/phys" target="_blank">studies on physical visualizations</a> at CHI, and contributed an <a href="http://www.aviz.fr/beyond" target="_blank">interaction model for beyond-desktop visualizations</a> at VIS&#8217;13.

<a href="http://petra.isenberg.cc" target="_blank">Petra Isenberg</a>, Inria

<p class="tab">
  is a research scientist at Inria, Saclay, France in the Aviz research group. Prior to joining Inria, Petra received her PhD from the University of Calgary in 2009 and her Diplom-degree in Computational Visualistics from the University of Magdeburg in 2004. Her main research areas are information visualization and visual analytics with a focus on collaborative work scenarios. She is interested in exploring how people can most effectively work together when analyzing large and complex data sets on novel display technology such as touch-screens, wall displays, or tabletops.

<p class="tab">
  is a Professor of Visualization at the giCentre, City University London. He has a background in geography (BA/MA, Oxford) and GIScience (MSc/PhD, Leicester) and much of his information visualization involves representing physical things in their spatial context through dynamic exploratory interfaces on the desktop. He is interested in representing physical things with physical objects and information about physical things in their physical context and in drawing upon the cartographic tradition to inform this activity.

<a href="http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca" target="_blank">Sheelagh Carpendale</a>, University of Calgary

<p class="tab">
  is a Professor in Computer Science at the University of Calgary where she holds a Canada Research Chair in Information Visualization and NSERC/AITF/SMART Technologies Industrial Research Chair in Interactive Technologies. She has received the NSERC E.W.R. Steacie Fellowship; a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts Interactive Awards); an ASTech Innovations in Technology award; and the CHCCS Achievement Award, which is presented periodically to a Canadian researcher who has made a substantial contribution to the fields of computer graphics, visualization, or human-computer interaction. She leads the Innovations in Visualization (InnoVis) research group and initiated the interdisciplinary graduate programs in Computational Media Design. Her research on information visualization, large interactive displays, and new media draws on her dual background in Computer Science (BSc. and Ph.D. Simon Fraser University) and Visual Arts (Sheridan College, School of Design and Emily Carr, College of Art).

<p class="tab">
  is a McKnight Land-Grant Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, where he directs the Interactive Visualization Lab. His research focuses on novel 3D user interfaces for visualization and modeling in virtual reality and other non-traditional computing environments. Keefe received a PhD in computer science from Brown University in 2007.
