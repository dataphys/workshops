Submission phase I is finished and we [compiled all scenario submissions][1] to spark pre-conference discussions.

We are now in **submission phase II**: inspiring and preparing the hands-on part of the workshop.

If you missed the scenario deadline, this is your chance to participate – although the fast-forward session will be limited to the phase I scenarios.

If you sent a scenario, you can highlight here your key ideas or identify emerging research themes or research questions, or other ideas that you have.

We welcome different types of contributions:

  * late scenario: if you missed the phase I deadline, you can still submit a scenario using this category (although the fast-forward session will be limited to the phase I scenarios);
  *  statement: a broad category to capture for example possible research themes, emerging research questions, or predictions;
  * paper abstract: for ideas on possible papers that you might write in xx years;
  * sketch / mockup: for static visual material; and
  * video: for dynamic visual material.

Try to be concrete and to place your contribution in a timeframe in the future indicated in the title, e.g.:

> 2025 &#8211; Researchers at Oxford bypass the eye &#8211; stimulating neurons to communicate simple glyphs
