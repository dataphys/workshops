We envision a mixed-reality future where there will be computers everywhere and all around us. We shall experience and regularly use virtual, augmented and hybrid reality systems, exploring information in an amalgamation of the physical and computer-generated space. These systems will be integrated across geography and will deliver powerful content seemlessly both at home and at work. Interaction opportunities with such systems are numerous and new modalities become available with each day. In coming years, we believe interaction with these systems will become a lot more standardized in both 3D spatial and 2D mediums. The interaction designs will borrow significantly from our daily natural interaction metaphors, supported by proven designs of techniques from the human-computer interaction community. Multi-modal and multi-party visualization will be made possible by the availability of commodity level display and interaction devices, supported by strong network connectivity capable of delivering vast amounts of data in real-time. This will result in transformative progress in the sciences and will significantly improve the quality of our lives.
