We are writing the year 2100, due to excessive usage of monitors human eye capability has dramatically diminished and the ability to speak has vanished. Humans are wearing digital glasses to see the world and get predictive information, and are communicating through instant thought messaging captured by neuro-captors. This evolution has plunged our society as we know it into a &#8220;Have&#8221; and &#8220;Have-not&#8221; society where the rich can chose what they want to see and the poor are submerged and flooded with biased information with the sole goal of making the rich richer and the poor poorer.
