&#8220;Le roi est mort, vive le roi!&#8221;; or &#8220;The King is dead, long live the King&#8221; was a phrase originally used for the French throne of Charles VII in 1422, upon the death of his father Charles VI. To stave civil unrest the governing figures wanted perpetuation of the monarchs. Likewise, while the desktop as-we-know-it is dead (the use of the WIMP interface is becoming obsolete in visualization) it is being superseded by a new type of desktop environment: a multisensory visualization space. 

This \`space&#8217; is still a personal workspace, it&#8217;s just a new kind of desk environment. 

Our vision is that data visualization will become more multisensory, integrating and demanding all our senses (sight, touch, audible, taste, smell etc.), to both manipulate and perceive the underlying data and information.
