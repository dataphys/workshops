&#8230;ElectroEncephaloGram(EEG) technologies and our ability to technologically sense electric fields evolve significantly past where they are now. 

Meanwhile human brain to computer communication using body-embedded-systems becomes De Rigueur, becoming extremely sophisticated and compact: we begin to embed these in our bodies &#8211; our communication, wayfinding and augmented analysis and processing are encapsulated in ourselves.

Your Will is the command for your own Personal Organic Network(PON)… 

It matters little where the data, connection and files are as the interface is your own body interfaced invisibly with the Network at large &#8211; functioning as as one: smoothly, invisibly &#8211; a question is asked&#8230;and answered in imagined visions in the canvas of the mind.
