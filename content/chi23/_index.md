<!-- # Physicalization from Theory to Practice -->

<!-- ## CHI 2023 Workshop -->



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />


## Call for Participation
  

Although data physicalizations have been around for centuries (e.g. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dataphys.org/list/peruvian-quipus/" target="_blank">Quipus</a>), little is known about how their context influences the design and interaction needs. For example, what does it mean for a physicalization to be designed for sustainability, and how does this differ from a physicalization placed in an office environment?

    

In this workshop, we will explore 4 domain areas of data physicalization: personal informatics, sustainability, education, and office vitality. We are particularly looking for people working in these exemplar domains, but are also open for applications from other domains. Through discussions and the creation of physicalizations, we will explore the needs and challenges of these domains. We invite experts in physicalization and the relevant domains to join us for this one-day workshop (click <a href="http://dataphys.org/workshops/chi23/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2022/12/chiea23-34_authorversion.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://dataphys.org/workshops/chi23/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2022/12/chiea23-34_authorversion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> for the full proposal).

{{< figure src="participate-1.png"  >}}  

If you are interested in participating, please submit a 2-page position paper (excluding references) or another medium that fits your work (e.g. video) that discusses at least on of the following: (i) one or more of the listed domain areas of physicalization; (ii) the challenges you see for the domain areas; (iii) your experience or vision on how context influences the design of a physicalization. Submissions should be submitted via <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forms.gle/Q1K7QgbZ7B6XsEn3A" data-type="URL" data-id="https://forms.gle/Q1K7QgbZ7B6XsEn3A" target="_blank">this</a> form (deadline February 23, 2023).

    

Successful submissions will be selected based on their ability to trigger discussion and will be published on the workshop&#8217;s website. For each accepted submission, at least one author must attend the workshop. All participants must register for the workshop and at least one conference day.
