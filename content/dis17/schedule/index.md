<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This full-day workshop will provide a rich hands-on introduction to questions around the pedagogy of Physicalization. We will explore current research questions as well as approaches to engaging people into designing physical data representations, while critically reflecting on the role these choices play in a learning environment. Through documented hands-on explorations, we seek to engage participants from different backgrounds in critical discussions about the potential, advantages, and limitations of data physicalization in different learning contexts. We will facilitate three main activities:</span>
