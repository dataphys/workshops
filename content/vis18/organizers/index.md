Trevor Hogan is a lecturer at the Cork Institute of Technology, Ireland, in the Human-data Interaction group. He received his PhD from the Bauhaus-Universitt Weimar, Germany. The aim of his research is to describe and better understand how embodiment influences and augments an audiences experience of data representation. His research has been presented and published at academic conferences and periodicals in fields such as HCI, Visualization, and Design. His work is strongly interdisciplinary and may be situated in the field of Design, but at the intersection of tangible computing, HCI, interactive design, information visualization, and psychology.

Uta Hinrichs is a Lecturer at the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, specializing in visualization and HCI. She received her PhD in Computer Science with specialization in Computational Media Design from the University of Calgary, Canada. Heavily drawing form fields outside of Computer Science (e.g., Design, Literary Studies, and Information Sciences), Uta&rsquo;s research is driven by the question of how to facilitate insightful, pleasurable and critical interactions with information in physical and digital spaces, both as part of professional activities and everyday life. As a visualization researcher Uta has been involved in number of collaborations with artists, historians, and literary scholars which have fueled her interest in the role of visualization as part of humanities research and practice. Her research has been presented and published at academic venues spanning the fields of Visualization, HCI, Literary Studies, and Digital Humanities.

Jason Alexander is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, UK. His primary research area is Human-Computer Interaction, with a particular interest in developing novel interactive systems to bridge the physical-digital divide. His recent work focuses on the development of shape-changing interfacessurfaces that can dynamically change their geometry based on digital content or user input. Jason&rsquo;s work on Data Physicalizations uses shape-changing interfaces to explore the use and understanding around dynamic physical data.

Samuel Huron is an associate professor in Design and ICT at Telecom Paris Tech. His research focuses on creating and studying new tools to democratize dynamic information visualization authoring and by studying design methods apply to research. For his work on &ldquo;Constructive Visualization&rdquo; he received the 2015 best doctoral dissertation award from IEEE VGTC Pioneer Group. Before, he was the lead designer of the Institute of Research and Innovation of the Pompidou Center. Samual co-organized previous workshop on data physicalization at ACM DIS 2017 and DRS 2016. He has written about pedagogy, visual representation construction, and using sketching for visualization.

Sheelagh Carpendale is a Professor in Computer Science at the University of Calgary where she holds a Canada Research Chair in Information Visualization and NSERC/AITF/SMART Technologies Industrial Research Chair in Interactive Technologies. She is a member of the ACM CHI Academy and has received many other awards including the E.W.R. NSERC STEACIE Fellowship; a BAFTA (British Academy of Film & Television Arts Interactive Awards); an ASTech Innovations in Technology award; and the CHCCS Achievement Award. She leads the Innovations in Visualization (InnoVis) research group and initiated the interdisciplinary graduate program, Computational Media Design. Her research focuses on information visualization, interaction design, and qualitative empirical work. By studying how people interact with information, images, technology and each other, she seeks to design and develop interactive technologies that support the everyday practices of people.

Eva Hornecker is a Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at the Bauhaus-Universit&uml;atWeimar, Germany. Her research investigates user experience and social interactions with tangible and embodied interaction, and novel application areas for these interaction styles, such as public displays and museum installations. Her work is&nbsp; interdisciplinary and connects technology, social sciences, arts, and design.
