<span style="font-size:14px"><span id="docs-internal-guid-5ab47089-741b-2206-9254-b9adcbf74049">Data physicalization is the practice of designing physical artifacts &ldquo;whose geometry or material properties encode data&rdquo;. It has a wide range of application areas including, design, architecture, education, and personal analytics (see </span><a href="http://www.dataphys.org" style="text-decoration:none">www.dataphys.org</a>/ for a comprehensive list). However, despite of the large variety of case studies in this area, a principled way of encoding data into physical artifacts has yet to be established. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different research communities (in particular visualization, HCI, and design) to discuss approaches toward a unified design language for data physicalization. </span>
